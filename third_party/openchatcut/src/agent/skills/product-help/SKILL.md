  OpenChatCut product knowledge — UI layout, editor features, and how generation providers are configured.
  Use when the user asks about the product interface, how to use a feature, where to find something, or needs GUI guidance for something the agent cannot do directly.
  Also use as fallback when a task fails and the user needs to complete it manually in the UI.
  NOT for live project-state queries ("where are my folders?", "what's on my timeline?", "where is clip X?") — those are answered by `read_project`, not by this skill.

# OpenChatCut Product Help

Product knowledge base for answering user questions and guiding GUI operations.

## When to Use

- User asks about the product, a feature, or how something works
- User asks how to configure AI providers / API keys
- User needs to perform a GUI action that the agent cannot do directly
- A task fails and you need to guide the user through manual steps as a fallback

## Reference Files

Read the relevant file on demand — do NOT read all files at once.

| Question about | File |
| --- | --- |
| Product UI, layout, panels, buttons, features | `references/ui-and-features.md` |
| API keys, providers, which features need a key | `references/providers-and-keys.md` |
| What generation models/tools are wired | `references/generation-capabilities.md` |
| Official generation API documentation | `references/generation-official-docs.md` |

## Guidelines

1. **Try to do it first.** If the task is something you can handle (adding captions, changing aspect ratio, etc.), do it. Only guide GUI operations as a fallback.
2. **Use visible UI names.** When guiding manual operations, give clear numbered steps with labels and panel locations that are confirmed in the references. If the user says they cannot find an entry, re-anchor from major visible regions such as the AI panel, top bar, asset/library panels, and timeline.
3. **Missing keys.** If a provider is not configured, say which key is missing and how to set it in Settings.
4. **Generation confirmations.** Some generation tools may show an in-app confirmation (skill guard / proposal) before running.
5. **Provider costs.** If the user asks about cloud cost, point them at their provider dashboard; do not invent rates.
