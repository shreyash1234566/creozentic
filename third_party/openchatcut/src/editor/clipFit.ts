//
// Two invariants:
// 1. Fade on both sides cannot overlap - fadeIn + fadeOut ≤ durationInFrames. Clamp each individually to full length
// It is not enough: a 100-frame clip can get 90-frame fade-in and 90-frame fade-out at the same time, fadeFactor takes both
// Smaller value, the entire segment will always be dark.
// 2. Keyframes cannot fall after the last frame - those frames will never be rendered.
//
// retime / setSpeed / split / deleting words and muting will change durationInFrames but ignore these two,
// So the repair is done at the exit of reduce instead of adding a guard in each case:
// One less branch means one less place to miss. By the way, the illegal values ​​that have been saved in the historical project will be self-healed.
